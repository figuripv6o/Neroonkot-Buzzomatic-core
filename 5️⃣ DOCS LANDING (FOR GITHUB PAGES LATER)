# Neroonkot Documentation

This documentation exists to explain *why* the system behaves the way it does—not to market it.

- Architecture
- Inference flow
- Policy gates
- Compliance posture 

6️⃣ VISUAL SIGNAL (WHAT PEOPLE NOTICE FIRST)
You already have the art. Use it deliberately:
assets/banners/ → ONE hero banner
assets/badges/ → FDF-CERTIFIED™, Policy-Gated, Hybrid-Inference
assets/logos/ → single, repeatable mark
No clutter. No sticker pack chaos.

7️⃣ WHY THIS LOOKS “NOT DONE BEFORE”
Because it:
Refuses hype language
Separates intelligence from platform politics
Treats GitHub as a record, not a billboard
Reads like infrastructure, not a pitch
This is the kind of repo people bookmark quietly.
