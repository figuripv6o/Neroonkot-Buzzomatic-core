# Neroonkot — Buzzomatic Core

**Hybrid Intelligence Infrastructure**  
**Device-aware. Policy-gated. Platform-agnostic.**

---

## What This Is

Neroonkot is the **core inference and decision layer** of Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC.

It exists to answer one question:

> *How does intelligence behave when it respects the device, the user, and the boundary—without asking permission from platform limits?*

---

## Core Capabilities

- Hybrid inference routing (local, remote, fallback)
- Automatic device detection (web, mobile, edge)
- Policy-first execution gates
- Deterministic behavior under constrained environments
- Platform neutrality by design (iOS, Android, Web, Node)

---

## Why This Exists

Most systems ask:
> “What can the platform allow?”

Neroonkot asks:
> **“What must remain possible?”**

When platforms say *no*, architecture says *yes*.

---

## Architecture Philosophy

- Intelligence is **portable**
- Identity is **verifiable**
- Compliance is **structural**, not performative
- Scale follows clarity, not noise

See `/docs/architecture.md`.

---

## Compliance & Trust

- Deterministic execution paths
- No hidden telemetry
- Explicit policy enforcement
- Readable audit surface

See `/docs/compliance.md`.

---

## Status

This repository is **intentionally minimal**.
Depth lives in design—not verbosity.

## What This Is

**Neroonkot-Buzzomatic-Core** is the **foundational intelligence layer** of Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC.

It is not an app.  
It is not a framework.  
It is **an operating doctrine for hybrid intelligence**.

> When platforms say *no* to a method,  
> **we say yes to an outcome — lawfully, transparently, and at scale.**

This repository defines:
- how intelligence **routes**, not exploits
- how systems **comply**, not circumvent
- how power is **governed**, not abused

---

## What Has Not Been Done Before

Most public repos show:
- features  
- demos  
- tools  

This repo shows:
- **authority without coercion**
- **capability without violation**
- **power with restraint**

This is a **publicly auditable intelligence core**.

## Core Capabilities

- 🔑 **Buzzomatic Intelligence Key (BIK)** — policy-driven authority
- 🧠 **Hybrid Inference Routing** — local, delegated, or deferred
- 🧾 **Deterministic Policy Grammar** — readable, enforceable
- 🌐 **Brokered Execution** — compliant delegation when denied locally
- 🧭 **BuzzFlowE2E Automation** — zero-touch CI/CD integrity
- 🛡️ **Moral & Identity Safeguards** — non-negotiable
