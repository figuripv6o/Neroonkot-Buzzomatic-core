## What This Is

**Neroonkot-Buzzomatic-Core** is the **foundational intelligence layer** of Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC.

It is not an app.  
It is not a framework.  
It is **an operating doctrine for hybrid intelligence**.

> When platforms say *no* to a method,  
> **we say yes to an outcome — lawfully, transparently, and at scale.**

This repository defines:
- how intelligence **routes**, not exploits
- how systems **comply**, not circumvent
- how power is **governed**, not abused
